              providing your information, you allow us to share this data with
              these third parties in line with our Privacy Policy. We reserve
              the right to cancel or refuse orders for reasons including
              product/service availability, errors in product/service
              descriptions or prices, or suspected fraud.

            <p className={styles.content}>
              Promotions available through the Service may have separate rules.
              If there is any conflict between these Terms and the rules of a
              specific promotion, the latter will prevail.

            <p className={styles.content}>
              We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service for any
              reason, including breaches of these Terms. Certain provisions,

            <p className={styles.content}>
              All orders are final. Refunds are not typically issued for annual
              subscriptions. For memberships, a 7-day 'cooling-off' period is
              available, during which you can cancel for a full refund, unless
              you've accessed member-only information or benefits. Physical
              product returns depend on the product type and condition.
